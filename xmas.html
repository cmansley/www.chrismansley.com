	This is just a collection of things that I have been thinking
	of researching and buying over the next 10 years :) This lists
	just represents a range of things. I expect (or desire) that
	no one actually purchases any of these things. Many are just
	day dreams. Just general information. My waist is a 36 and my
	shoe size is 14-15. I am typically an XL in shirts, but
	sometimes L fits better :(

	    Boxers. I am running low. Traditionally, I enjoy prints with fun stuff on them from "fancy" brands like J. Crew and Patagonia.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Socks. Everyone should know about my smartwool addiction. The low cut running socks are currently the ones in need of replacement.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Linen Towel. Supposedly, linen towels are the best for
	    quick, drying and not smelling. Perfect for a bike ride to
	    work and then shower. They also pack
	    smaller. This <a href="https://shop.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/grid-linen-towel.html">one</a>
	    seems to be the one everyone points to, but it is too rich
	    for my blood.
