	This is just a collection of things that I have been thinking
	of researching and buying over the next 10 years :) This lists
	just represents a range of things. I expect (or desire) that
	no one actually purchases any of these things. Many are just
	day dreams. Just general information. My waist is a 36 and my
	shoe size is 14-15. I am typically an XL in shirts, but
	sometimes L fits better :(

	    Boxers. I am running low. Traditionally, I enjoy prints with fun stuff on them from "fancy" brands like J. Crew and Patagonia.

	    Socks. Everyone should know about my smartwool addiction. The low cut running socks are currently the ones in need of replacement.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Linen Towel. Supposedly, linen towels are the best for
	    quick, drying and not smelling. Perfect for a bike ride to
	    work and then shower. They also pack
	    smaller. This <a href="https://shop.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/grid-linen-towel.html">one</a>
	    seems to be the one everyone points to, but it is too rich
	    for my blood.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Stylish hoodies. I have this black one from my motorcycle
	    jacket, but I should get another one. I think the zip up
	    is the best bet, but the guy at Bosch had a sweet cowl
	    necked one. I can't rock the
	    <a href="http://www.volantedesign.us/product/the-ninja-run-1/">ninja
	    look</a>

	    First pilot lesson. I have been thinking about it for
	    awhile, but I have no idea if it would jive with me. There
	    are several schools and I don't know what to do. For
	    example,
	    this <a href="http://www.flybayarea.com/flight-school/">one</a>
	    offers a 1-hour intro lesson where you get actual
	    knowledge. (not just fly for a couple of minutes).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Cycling jacket/rain jacket. I hate having multiple clothes
	    for multiple purposes. My existing cycling jacket has
	    given up after 5 years. And my rain jacket has given up
	    after 10 years. I wanted a single cycling/rain jacket and
	    this <a href="https://www.showerspass.com/products/refuge-jacket"></a>one
	    from Showers Pass seems to fit the bill. The black or the
	    red is nice. But, then again I love Patigonia stuff, I
	    wish I matched their "model" build (rock climber, skinny
	    and
	    wiry). The <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-torrentshell-rain-jacket/83802.html">Torrentshell</a>,
	    I think, is their standard rain jacket. But, it is not
	    very cycling friendly.
